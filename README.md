# Picas & FijasâŒ›

Picas & Fijas is a game that challenges you to guess a 4 digit number.

The interesing part? You'll guess it by using two types of hints, *picas* and *fijas*.

[You can give it a try **here**](https://nicolasbm.dev/picas).

## Description:

Picas & Fijas can make your waiting on any line, a little bit more entertained. This is because there's only 2 possible outcomes: you find the secret number in 4 minutes, or, you have to shut down the game because it's your turn and thus, you'll continue to wonder for the rest of the day, *what number could have been it?*.

My father taught me this game on a piece of paper over 10 years ago. Now, with my ever growing programing skills, my goal is to make it accessible for everyone and why not, create new cool features for it as well.

## Technical objectives:

- Build the logic for input validation using react hooks.
- Build extra hint system to assist players using the input's placeholder property.
- Save history of games using Window's Local Storage.
- Style using tailwindcss 3.
- Build *how to play* section using tailwind animations.

## Currently working on:

- Adding english language support.
- Implementing React Router to add funtionalities like continue a game that was not finished and future game types.
- Currenty learning Three.js to add more interesting visuals with 3D and physics. 


## Previous versions:

- First iteration was built by my dad using Visual Basic and Excel. If you want to give it a try, here's the link for the [Excel version](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0BzP5XSAoRa9WVGVidkQwTTkxU1U&export=download) (please be aware since the excel has macros, sometimes it is detected as potentialy malicious by antiviruses, but it isn't).
- Second version was built by me using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is also deployed and you can find it [here](https://nicolasbm.dev/picas/v1/), however it is a beta version of only the logic and not too much on the styling. **(** *pssh, in this version you can press F12 to get a big  hint* **)**.
